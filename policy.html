                  obtain your consent. Every time visited, this website records

                  subsidiary of the inquirer, for processing and use, and
                  exchanges the data with this branch. For example, inquiries
                  and the corresponding data from the website for Switzerland
                  (www.Viton Transport Services Ltd..com/ch) are exchanged with

                  third country is Art. 49 Para. 1 b) of the GDPR. Users are
                  given the option of subscribing to the Viton Transport
                  Services Ltd. newsletter (e.g., "eLetter") on the Viton
                  Transport Services Ltd. website. The personal data that are
                  recorded when subscribing to the Viton Transport Services Ltd.
                  newsletter can be seen on the input screen. Viton Transport
                  Services Ltd. uses the newsletter to provide information on a
                  regular basis to customers and business partners about
                  innovations of our services and production, current press
                  releases, information about our brand or the current contents
                  of our website. The newsletter can fundamentally only be
                  received by the person affected if (1) the person affected has
                  a valid email address and (2) the person affected registers
                  for receipt of the newsletter. For legal reasons, a
                  confirmation email is initially sent to the registered email
                  address of the affected person in a double opt-in procedure
                  for receipt of the newsletter. This confirmation email serves
                  as a check to ensure that the owner of the email address as
                  the person affected has authorized the receipt of the
                  newsletter. The legal basis for sending the newsletter is Art.
                  6 Para. 1 a) of the GDPR. Upon registration for the
                  newsletter, we store the IP address of the internet service

                  at the time of registration as well as the date and time of
                  registration. The recording of this data is required to be
                  able to identify the (possible) misuse of the email address of
                  the person affected at a later point in time and therefore
                  also to guarantee legal protection of Viton Transport Services
                  Ltd.The personal data collected as part of the registration
                  process for the newsletter are used exclusively for the
                  following purposes: Dispatch of the newsletter Advice and
                  advertising Needs-related structure of the newsletter
                  Compilation of the topics in the newsletter in line with the
                  interests of subscribers In addition, subscribers to the
                  newsletter could be informed by email insofar as this is
                  necessary for the operation of the newsletter services or a
                  registration with regard to this, such as for changes to the
                  offer or a modification to the technical circumstances.
                  Consent to the storage of personal data that the person
                  affected has given us for the subscription to the newsletter
                  can be revoked at any time. There is a corresponding link in
                  every newsletter for the revocation of consent. In addition,
                  it is also possible to deregister at any time directly with
                  Viton Transport Services Ltd. by sending a notification to the
                  contact details given under number 1. Our newsletters contain
                  tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that
                  is embedded in such emails that are sent in HTML format to
                  facilitate the recording and analyzing a log file. This means
                  that a statistical analysis of the success or failure of
                  online marketing campaigns can be carried out. By means of the
                  embedded tracking pixels, Viton Transport Services Ltd. can
                  identify whether and when an email was opened by a person
                  affected and which of the links in the email were accessed by
                  the person affected. Such personal data recorded via the
                  tracking pixels contained in the newsletter are saved and
                  evaluated by Viton Transport Services Ltd. to optimize the
                  dispatch of newsletters and to align the contents of future
                  newsletters better to the interests of the person affected.
                  Persons affected are entitled to revoke the separate
                  declaration of consent given via the double opt-in procedure
                  at any time. Following a revocation, these personal data are
                  deleted by Viton Transport Services Ltd.. Deregistration of
                  the subscription to the newsletter is automatically deemed by
                  Viton Transport Services Ltd. to be a revocation. This website
                  uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are placed on a

                  Viton Transport Services Ltd. is able to provide you with
                  user-friendly services that would not be possible if the
                  cookies had not been placed. Cookies enable us to recognize
                  the users of our website. For example, the user of a website
                  that uses cookies does not have to enter his/her login data
                  every time he/she visits the website, because these are taken
                  from the website and the cookie placed by the website on the
                  computer system. You can prevent the placing of cookies by our
                  website at any time by means of a corresponding setting of
                  your internet browser and consequently prevent the setting of
                  cookies on a permanent basis. In addition, cookies that have
                  already been placed can be deleted at any time via an internet

                  standard internet browsers. However, if you deactivate the
                  placing of cookies in your internet browser, not all the
                  functions of our website will be fully available to you in
                  certain circumstances. The legal basis for the processing of
                  personal data using cookies is Art. 6 Para. 1 f) of the GDPR.
                  We use the offer from Google Maps on this website. This means
                  that we can show you interactive maps directly on the website
                  and enable you to use the map features simply and easily. By
                  accessing its website, Google obtains information that you
                  have visited the corresponding sub-site on our website. In
                  addition, the data mentioned under number 2 are transmitted.
                  This occurs irrespective of whether Google makes a user
                  account available, via which you are logged in, or if there is
                  no user account. If you are logged in to Google, your data are
                  directly allocated to your account. If you do not wish this
                  allocation to your profile with Google, you must log out
                  before activating the button. Google stores your data as a
                  usage profile and uses this for the purposes of advertising,
                  market research and/or the needs-related structuring of its
                  website. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even
                  for users who do not log in) to provide needs-related
                  advertising and to inform other users in your social network
                  of your activities on our website. You have a right to object
                  to the creation of this user profile, but you have to contact
                  Google directly to enforce this. Further information on the
                  purpose and scope of the data collection and the processing
                  thereof by the plugin service provider can be found in the
                  data protection declaration of the service provider. The legal
                  basis for the processing of your personal data when using
                  Google Maps is Art. 6 Para. 1 f) of the GDPR. The transmission
                  of personal data to the USA is carried out in compliance with
                  the EU-US Privacy Shield pursuant to Art. 45 Para. 1 of the
                  GDPR, of which Google is a signatory. We use the social
                  plugins (“Plugins”) of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Xing and
                  LinkedIn on our website. We use plugins in particular so that
                  you can share the contents of our website with other users of
                  social networks or you can refer them to these contents. You
                  can identity the provider of the relevant plugin from its logo
                  or initial letter. When you visit our website, we do not
                  initially transmit any personal data to the plugin provider.
                  However, if you click the relevant field, your personal data
                  are sent directly to the provider of the relevant plugin and
                  processed by said provider in third countries such as the USA
                  under certain circumstances. After you click a plugin field, a
                  new window opens in your browser and calls up the website of
                  the provider of the relevant social network. The data transfer
                  to the provider of the relevant plugin is carried out
                  irrespective of whether you have an account with the social
                  network of said plugin provider. Once you have logged on to
                  the plugin provider, your data that have been registered with
                  us are directly transmitted to the account you have with the
                  plugin provider. We have no influence on the type and scope of
                  the data that are collected and processed by using the plugin,
                  nor do we know the full scope of the data collection, the
                  purposes of the processing or the storage periods. According
                  to the information of the plugin provider, the data
                  transmitted include information about your browser, the
                  websites that you have visited as well as the date and time of
                  your visit. The plugin providers process this information to
                  create a user profile and to create tailor-made advertising
                  for you, for example. You have a right to object to the
                  creation of this user profile, but you have to contact the
                  respective plugin provider directly to enforce this revocation
                  right. You will find further information on this on the
                  internet sites and in the data protection declarations of the
                  relevant service providers. The legal basis for the processing
                  of your personal data when using social plugins is Art. 6
                  Para. 1 f) of the GDPR. The transmission of personal data to
                  the USA is carried out in compliance with the EU-US Privacy
                  Shield pursuant to Art. 45 Para. 1 of the GDPR, to which
                  Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google are signatories. The
                  criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is
                  the relevant statutory storage period. Once this deadline has
                  expired, we routinely delete all the corresponding data
                  insofar as they are no longer required to fulfill or initiate
                  a contract. If the reason for storage no longer applies or if
                  the storage deadline set by the European regulator or another
                  relevant legislator should expire, the personal data are
                  routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with statutory
                  provisions. Your rights As a person affected, you are entitled
                  to the rights as set out in Articles 15-21 of the GDPR
                  vis-à-vis Viton Transport Services Ltd. if the prerequisites
                  set out therein have been fulfilled. These are the rights to
                  information (Art. 15 of the GDPR), correction (Art. 16 of the
                  GDPR), deletion (Art. 17 of the GDPR), restriction in
                  processing (Art. 18 of the GDPR), data transfer (Art. 20 of
                  the GDPR) and the right to object (Art. 21 and 22 of the
                  GDPR). In addition, you have a right to complain to the
                  supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 77 of the GDPR.
